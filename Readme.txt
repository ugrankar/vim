This is my 64 bit gVim for Windows 7 and related configuration files.

gVim Downloaded from - https://bintray.com/veegee/generic/vim_x64/view
Consolas for Powerline fonts downloaded from another repository on Github.

Please note - Please do read the comments at the top of my _vimrc. I'm not using the
diff that comes preloaded with standard gVim.
